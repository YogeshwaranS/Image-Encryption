# Image-Encryption
A java Application to encrypt images

## Introduction
In this project uses techniques based on Visual cryptography to encrypt and decrypt images. Visual cryptography is a cryptographic method for securing images. In visual cryptography images are divided into n-number of shares which provide security for the images and stacking or overlapping of these shares reveal the original secret image. 

## Prerequisites
